Arduino-SMS-Doorbell
======================
This project enables house visitors to announce their arrival via text.  In order to verify that the
visitor is truly at the door, incomming texts must include a code that is time generated by an Arduino
Leonardo combined with an LCD and push button (prebuilt when using the TinkerKit LCD and button module).

Incomming text messages are turned into speech using the eSpeak TTS library and broadcast via a Sonos
and Yamaha network capable receiver.
