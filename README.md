Arduino-SMS-Doorbell
======================
This project enables house visitors to announce their arrival via an Arduino based doorbell.  The
Arduino integrates to a Raspberry Pi via bluetooth to control a Yamaha digital receiver and a Sonos as the
sound source.  It also supports custom announcements by SMS and text-to-speech integration. In order to verify 
that the visitor is truly at the door, incomming texts must include a code that is time generated by an Arduino
Leonardo combined with an LCD and push button (prebuilt when using the TinkerKit LCD and button module).
